## About

In March 2020 I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. I had always wanted to learn how to make sourdough bread. Sourdough seemed so romantic with its natural fermentation, hipster sour flavor, and wholesome loaves. But sourdough felt otherworldly, akin to magic. In the same way that playing guitar, programming and skateboarding are also all magic. I needed to become a wizard!

I knew becoming a wizard takes time, energy, and focus. I think that's why so many people were able to take up baking during the pandemic. We all had time, energy and a desire to focus on anything other the news. I found my [sourdough bible](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/) and obtained some [donated mother aka starter](https://cheeseboardcollective.coop/). I then set out each week to bake something nourishing and delicious. And I found out that I enjoyed the process, the art, and the growth (magic prerequisites!). I am starting this bread blog because I want to remember my loaves, iterate, share my learnings, and celebrate. Thanks for reading!
