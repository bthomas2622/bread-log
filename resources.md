A collection of my favorite guides, resources, and recipes I have encountered on my sourdough adventures. 

### **General**

- **[Tartine Book No. 3](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17557476-tartine-book-no-3)** (Book) - The whole + ancient grain followup to [Tartine Bread](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185785-tartine-bread). Tartine Book No. 3 is a world tour of naturally leavened bread traditions. Perfect for bakers looking to the next adventure after perfecting the country loaf.

- **[Tartine Bread](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185785-tartine-bread)** (Book) - Maybe the most famous of Sourdough books. Chad Robertson's romantic quest for the perfect sourdough loaf (that can be made by the home baker) is a great resource for getting started, inspiration, and sourdough fundamentals.

- **[The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/)** (Blog) - My absolute favorite resource. Maurizio is detailed, romantic, and organized. His guides encompass all experience levels and his recipes are easy to follow and delicious. 

### **Sourdough Starter / Mother**

- **[Joshua Weissman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4WiRZw8bmXsPMMqSf8Ei3XtGkV88Ln3J)** (YouTube) - A collection of videos on sourdough starter and mother. Joshua Weissman is a super charismatic Youtuber who has created some truly wonderful videos on sourdough starter. 

### **Kneading**

- **[Slap and Fold - The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/guides/slap-and-fold/)** (Web) - Maurizio at The Perfect Loaf has a great guide on the Slap and Fold technique. A kneading technique to build strength in exceedingly wet or low gluten sourdough.

### **Flour**

- **[Battle of the Ancient Grains - True Food TV](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/guides/slap-and-fold/)** (YouTube) - True Food TV has a great video comparing Spelt/Einkorn/Emmer/Kamut ancient grains with some backstory, education, and a bakeoff.
