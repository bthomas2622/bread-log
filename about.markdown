In March 2020 I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. I had always wanted to learn how to make sourdough bread. Sourdough seemed so romantic with its natural fermentation, hipster sour flavor, and wholesome loaves. But sourdough was magic. In the same way that playing guitar, programming, speaking multiple languages, and skateboarding are also all magic. They seem so out of reach, but there are wizards out there who have shown that it is possible. I wanted to become a wizard!

I knew becoming a wizard takes time, energy, and focus. I think that's why so many people were able to take up baking during the pandemic. Because we all had the time, energy and desire to focus on anything but the news! With my [sourdough bible](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/) I set out each week to bake something nourishing and delicious. And I found out that I enjoyed the process, the art, and the growth (magic prerequisites!). I am starting this bread blog because I want to remember my loaves, iterate, share, and celebrate. Thanks for reading!
