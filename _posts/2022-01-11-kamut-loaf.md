### <=4 Sentence Bake Review
I am back at it after a long break. I attempted a new recipe using majority [Kamut (khorasan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorasan_wheat) flour. Results can be summed up in 1 word. FLAT! 

### Recipe
This recipe is from [Tartine Book No. 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F8H0FKU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). 

**2 Loaves**
Whole-grain Kamut flour - 600g
Medium-strong wheat flour, sifted - 200g
High-extraction wheat flour - 200g
Wheat germ - 70g
Water - 850g
Leaven - 150g
Fine sea salt - 25g

### Hot Takes + Notes
I was very excited to try this new ancient grain flour type for a sourdough loaf. I ordered it special from [Central Milling](https://centralmilling.com/) since I couldn't find it locally. 

[Chad Robertson](https://tartinebakery.com/about), the author of [Tartine Book No. 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F8H0FKU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) did speak about how these ancient grains have less gluten than contemporary wheat varieties so building strength in the dough is more of a challenge. 

**What went wrong:**
In the end I was not successful at building dough strength and that resulted in exceedingly flat loaves!

**Things to fix for next time:**
1. Make sure starter is truly ready to rumble. Billy the Sourdough Starter has been in maintenance mode for some time now coming out of the fridge sporadically. He needs some more love before attempting this loaf again. My leaven did not pass the float test but I ran out of time. 
2. Potentially use less water, maybe attempting the full prescribed water amount was ambitious as my dough was super slack. 
3. Preshape twice to give dough more structure.
